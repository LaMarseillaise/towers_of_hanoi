# Towers of Hanoi

The Tower of Hanoi is a puzzle game created by Ã‰douard Lucas in the 19th century. The goal is to move discs, which are of different sizes, from one of three pegs to another, by moving only one disc at a time and never placing a larger disc on top of a smaller one. This gem provides both an API for building this game and a CLI version of the game for demonstration.
